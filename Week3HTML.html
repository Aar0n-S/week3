    <h1>Have you ever made pizza before from scratch</h1>
    <h2>Yeah, but have you relly thought about it?</h2>
    <h3>Like, how if you put the sauce on first, before you make the base it doesn't work?</h3>
    <h4>Or, if you put the cheese on then the sauce it's messed up too</h4>

   <!-- Add some copy here--> 
    <p class="special">Making a pizza is simialr to coding. There are certain things we do first. Like making the base, letting it rise, mould the base out, add the sauce, add the toppings, add the cheese, bake and cut and serve. Not all pizzas end up the same, but they do start out in the same way as long as you follow the order correctly. You can have everything you need to make many differnet pizzas using the same base structure that is set up before hand. </p>
